I’ve built my foundation in quantum computing by doing the work—building projects, teaching others, and digging into research.

I co‑founded and serve as Vice President of the Quantum High School Organization (QHSO). I design tailored lesson plans and run webinars and workshops for audiences ranging from high schoolers to graduate students.

During a research internship with QWorld at 2023, I focused on quantum state tomography. I implemented and compared classical and quantum machine‑learning approaches on real quantum hardware and simulators, reaching 98% fidelity in state reconstruction. That work was published in Quantum Machine Intelligence.

I like making complex ideas approachable. I built a beginner‑friendly Jupyter notebook with Qiskit to teach core concepts like gates and circuits, hosted on my GitHub as QHSO_Basics_of_Qiskit. I also wrote the Bronze Pytket tutorial with support from Quantinuum to guide newcomers through quantum programming.

I explore hybrid quantum‑classical models too. In my QCNN‑vs‑CNN‑Performance‑Analysis repo, I compared a quantum convolutional neural network against a classical baseline on MNIST: the quantum model reached 90.54% accuracy and beat the classical one by more than 8 percentage points.

Day to day, I work with Qiskit, Pytket, and Cirq. I’ve received QWorld’s Best Project and Best Presentation awards, and I contribute to open source through unitary HACK 2025, including:

mitiq: a tutorial combining four error‑mitigation techniques
paulipropagation.jl: a Python usage notebook
qualtran: docstrings for basic gates like CZPowGate and Rx/Ry
quantumarthack: a function to mix circuits with QPIXL input
scqubits: code documentation improvements

I’ve also attended IBM’s Qiskit Summer School (2023 and 2025) and participated in the Qiskit Quantum Challenge. These experiences have strengthened my practical skills in building and optimizing quantum circuits.
